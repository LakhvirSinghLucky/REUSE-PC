    <h1>History</h1>
    <article>
        Originally created by a designer and a developer LAKHVIR SINGH From Swami Premanand Mahavidhalaya, Mukerian (PUNJAB), REUSE-PC has become one of the most popular site in the world for selling and buying new electronics.

 REUSE-PC was created in Aug-2023 by @LAKHVIR SINGH. A few months into development, site got its first Hack Week and the project exploded as developers of all skill levels jumped in without any external guidance. It served as the style guide for internal tools development at the company for over a year before its public release, and continues to do so today.

Originally released on (TO BE RELEASED YET) we’ve since had over twenty releases, including two major rewrites, we added responsive functionality to the entire framework as an optional stylesheet. Building on that with Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the library once more to make it responsive by default with a mobile first approach.

, we once again rewrote the project to account for two key architectural changes: a migration to the move flexbox. Our intention is to help in a small way to move the web development community forward by pushing for newer properties, fewer dependencies, and new technologies across more modern browsers.

Our latest release focuses on improving codebase with as few major breaking changes as possible. We improved existing features and components, removed support for older browsers, dropped jQuery for regular JavaScript, and embraced more future-friendly technologies like CSS custom properties as part of our tooling.
